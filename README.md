# Authentication and Authorization in React

This project is a simple authentication and authorization system built using ReactJS and Context API. It allows users to sign up, log in, and access restricted routes based on their roles.

## Features
- User login: Registered users can log in using their username and password.

- Authorization: Access to certain routes is restricted based on user permission.

- Protected routes: Some routes require authentication. Users must be logged in to access these routes.

- Logout: Users can log out of their account, which will clear their session and revoke their access token.

## Technologies Used
- ReactJS: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Context API: A state management system provided by React for sharing data across components.
- React Router: A routing library for React that enables navigation and routing within the application.
- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Tokens are used for authentication and authorization.
- Cookie and LocalStorage : you can choose the storage for store the jwt bearer and user permissions.


## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
### `git clone https://github.com/info-aliahmadi/AuthInReact.git`

2. Install the dependencies:
### `npm install`

3. Configure the API endpoint:
In the src/utils/appConfig.js file, update the API_PATH constant with the appropriate URL for your backend API.

4. Run the development server:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
